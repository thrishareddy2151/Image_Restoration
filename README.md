## IMAGE RESTORATION USING GAN
<h5>Project overview</h5>
The project aims to enhance image quality through restoration and clarity improvement using Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs). By reconstructing low-resolution, blurry, or damaged images, the GAN
model is expected to learn the mapping between degraded inputs and their high-quality counterparts.
Through adversarial training and loss minimization, the model will be designed to progressively improve
its ability to recover fine details and generate visually realistic outputs. The proposed approach holds
strong potential in addressing real-world visual challenges, particularly in areas such as photography
enhancement, medical imaging, and surveillance.
